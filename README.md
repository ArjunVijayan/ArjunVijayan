🔍 Arjun — Data Scientist | LLM & Multimodal AI Specialist | End-to-End ML & Analytics
Welcome! I’m a data scientist passionate about solving real-world problems with machine learning, statistical modeling, and generative AI. My work spans churn prediction, customer analytics, document automation, and intelligent agents powered by LLMs and multimodal pipelines.

I specialize in building end-to-end solutions — from data exploration and modeling to deployment and business integration — with a strong focus on explainability, automation, and performance.

🔧 What I Do
📈 Predictive & Causal Modeling

Churn prediction, time-to-event modeling, CLV forecasting

Uplift modeling using causal inference for decision optimization

SHAP- and chi2-based feature explanations

📊 Data Analysis & Business Intelligence

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and automated insights

Funnel analysis and behavioral segmentation

Custom KPI dashboards and data storytelling

🧠 LLM Agents & Retrieval Systems

HR policy Q&A bots, meeting summarizers, email writing agents

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems using vector stores

Excel-integrated LLM pipelines for intelligent spreadsheet automation

🖼️ Multimodal & Document AI

PDF image extraction and visual summarization

Image-based search and generative prompting for creative workflows

Slide generation from Excel using LLMs and layout intelligence

💡 Notable Projects
📉 Customer Analytics Engine (Solo Project)
Built a complete system for customer churn prediction, time-to-event modeling, CLV estimation, and uplift scoring.

Applied tree-based models and survival analysis

Used SHAP for explainability and segment-level reasoning

Developed custom confidence metrics for predictions

🧾 Auto Slide Generator
Excel-to-slide LLM pipeline for transforming raw data tables into annotated, contextual presentations.

Added support for financial and sales reports

Includes visual layout selection and tone control

🧠 Meeting Tracker Agent
Agent that analyzes past meeting transcripts, PDFs, and action logs to summarize project status over time.

Tracks decisions, detects incomplete actions

Updates summarized PDFs with new discussion points

🖼️ PDF Visual Extractor
Built a multimodal pipeline to extract images from PDFs and analyze them with vision-language models.

Enables visual search, classification, and slide augmentation

✍️ AI Writing Assistant
Email and document-writing agent that adapts tone, format, and language based on context.

Detects recipients using embeddings and prior communication

Suggests content edits for clarity and persuasion

📊 Analytical Projects
Sales Funnel Analysis: Created phase-level breakdowns (initiation → conversion), identifying drop-off drivers

Retention Metrics Reporting: Automated churn/retention dashboards with cohort and survival visualizations

Keyword Predictive Power Analyzer: Developed chi-squared-based keyword analysis for CRM and ticket systems

Temporal Drift Detection: Time-aware validation of labels and feature drift monitoring in live models

🛠️ Tech Stack
Languages & Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, PyTorch, LangChain, OpenAI, Excel, SQL
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Streamlit, Power BI
Deployment & Ops: FastAPI, Docker, Azure, AWS, Git
Vector DBs & Embeddings: FAISS, Chroma, Pinecone, Sentence Transformers

🚀 Let’s Connect
I enjoy working on cutting-edge applications of ML and AI — especially those that blend creativity, data, and decision-making. Open to collaborations, consulting opportunities, and interesting use cases!
